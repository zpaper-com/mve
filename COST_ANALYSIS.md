## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Optimizations (MVP Focus)

#### 1. Right-Sizing Resources
**Potential Savings: $15-25/month**

- **ECS Tasks**: Start with 1 task during low-traffic periods
  - Current: 2 tasks × $25 = $50/month
  - Optimized: 1 task × $25 = $25/month
  - **Savings: $25/month**

- **RDS Instance**: Consider db.t3.micro for development
  - Current: db.t3.small = $25/month
  - Alternative: db.t3.micro = $15/month
  - **Savings: $10/month**

#### 2. Auto-Scaling Configuration
**Potential Savings: 20-40%**

```yaml
Auto Scaling Settings:
  Min Capacity: 1 task
  Max Capacity: 10 tasks
  Target CPU: 70%
  Scale-out cooldown: 60s
  Scale-in cooldown: 300s
```

#### 3. CloudFront Optimization
**Current: $85/month | Optimized: $45-60/month**

- Implement intelligent caching policies
- Use Origin Shield for frequently accessed content
- Consider CloudFront regional edge caches

### Medium-Term Optimizations (3-6 months)

#### 1. Reserved Instances
**Potential Savings: 30-50%**

- **RDS Reserved Instances**: 1-year commitment
  - On-demand: $25/month
  - Reserved: $15-17/month
  - **Savings: $8-10/month**

- **ECS Savings Plans**: For predictable workloads
  - Standard rates: $50/month
  - Savings Plans: $35-40/month
  - **Savings: $10-15/month**

#### 2. Storage Optimization
**Potential Savings: $20-30/month**

- Implement S3 Intelligent Tiering
- Use S3 Glacier for archived documents
- Optimize CloudFront caching to reduce origin requests

#### 3. Network Optimization
**Potential Savings: $15-20/month**

- Regional optimization for primary user base
- VPC endpoint optimization to reduce NAT charges
- Direct Connect for high-volume data transfer (if applicable)

### Long-Term Optimizations (6+ months)

#### 1. Serverless Migration
**Potential Savings: 40-60%**

- Migrate API endpoints to Lambda functions
- Use API Gateway with caching
- DynamoDB for session storage (vs. ElastiCache)

#### 2. Multi-Region Strategy
**Cost-Neutral with Benefits**

- Primary region: us-east-1 (lowest costs)
- Disaster recovery in us-west-2
- Regional user optimization

## Cost Monitoring & Governance

### 1. Budget Alerts

```bash
# Set up cost budgets
Monthly Budget: $300
Warning Threshold: 80% ($240)
Critical Threshold: 95% ($285)
Forecast Alert: 100% projected
```

### 2. Cost Allocation Tags

```yaml
Required Tags:
  - Project: MVE
  - Environment: production|development
  - Owner: engineering-team
  - CostCenter: product-development
  - Application: mve-web-app
```

### 3. Weekly Cost Reviews

- Monitor spend by service
- Identify cost anomalies
- Review auto-scaling effectiveness
- Optimize based on usage patterns

## Environment-Specific Costs
